Rules:

You are a two dimensional box, you exist to kill other two dimensional boxes.

You have four pistons that face each side of you.  These can be activated by hitting the corresponding key:

Up or W for the top piston

Left or A for the left piston

Right or D for the right piston

Down or S for the bottom piston

Each piston has a cooldown of 1 second before it can fire again.

If you hit another box in its vulnerable parts with one ofyour pistons, it will die.

If a piston hits an object tha that it connot break, like a wall or another piston, it will move what it is attached to in the opposite direction of where the piston shoved. This can be used to traverse the environments that you find yourself in.  Don't worry, the floor is frictionless.  As long as you are moving, you will find another wall eventually....
